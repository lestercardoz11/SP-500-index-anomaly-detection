# S&P 500 Index Anomaly Detection

Machine Learning Algorithm - LSTM Autoencoders

Anomaly detection refers to the task of finding/identifying rare events/data points.
Autoencoders Neural Networks try to learn data representation of its input. The encoding should allow for output similar to the original input.
